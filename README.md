# Explainable AI for Cancer Detection in Histopathology

This project applies **Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping)** to a **ResNet-50** model trained for **binary classification** of histopathological images (cancerous vs. non-cancerous). The goal is to improve the interpretability of deep learning predictions in medical imaging.

## ðŸ§  Overview

While deep convolutional neural networks achieve high accuracy in cancer detection, their decision-making process is often considered a "black box." To address this, **Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping)** is applied to provide visual explanations by highlighting the most important regions in the image influencing the model's prediction.

## ðŸ”¬ Model Details

- **Architecture**: ResNet-50
- **Task**: Binary classification of breast cancer in histopathology images
- **Explainability**: Grad-CAM for visual interpretation of predictions

Grad-CAM works by using the gradients of the target class flowing into the last convolutional layer to produce a coarse localization map, highlighting **which parts of the input image contributed most to the prediction**.
